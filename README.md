# **INTRODUCTION**

TaskApp is a simple, yet effective task management application designed to help individuals keep track of their tasks. 
It allows users to create an account, and once logged in, manage their tasks by adding, viewing, editing, or deleting them.

# **FEATURES**

User Registration and Authentication: Users can create an account with a username and password. Passwords are hashed using SHA-256 to maintain security. User sessions are also managed to enable a secure user experience.

Task Management: After logging in, users can create tasks with specific details such as task name, priority level (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH), deadline, and a brief description.

Viewing Tasks: Users can view all their tasks in a simple, user-friendly interface.

Editing Tasks: If a user wants to edit the details of a task, they can do so easily with the Edit task option.

Deleting Tasks: Users can also delete tasks once they're completed or no longer needed.

# **FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS**

Future versions of TaskApp plan to include features like:


Password Recovery: If a user forgets their password, they'll be able to recover it through a secure process. 

Brute Force Attack Protection: Additional security measures to lock accounts after a certain number of unsuccessful login attempts.

Task Filtering and Sorting: Allow users to filter and sort tasks based on due date, priority, completion status, etc.

# **PREREQUISITES**

TaskApp requires Java 11 to run. 
It's a simple console-based application which can be run directly from the command line or from within an IDE such as IntelliJ.
